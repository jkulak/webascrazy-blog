Series for developers regardless from the programming language they are using.
Usually from beginner to medium level.

Something I would share with developers that I would like to work with so we can express our ideas using the same language.

- ip addresses
- caching
- bits, bytes, encoding
    - resource: http://kunststube.net/encoding/

- big o notation
- web security
    - db configuration
    - code
    - server configuration
- differences in programming languages
- approach: proper tool for the job + proper skillset for the job
