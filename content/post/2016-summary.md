## tl;dr

2016 brought many changes in my life, and thanks to 11 months of holidays in Mexico, I had plenty of time to organize my dev stuff and finish/close remaining projects.

It has been a year of

- `docker-compose up`
- `man git`
- `go build`
- `gulp test`
- `pm2 start --no-daemon process.json`
- `_markdown_`
- üò≥üëåüèª emojis
- [chilaquiles in Mexico](https://www.instagram.com/iamchilaquiles/)
- podcasts (read which [podcasts I enjoy](/2016/12/11/podcasts-i-enjoy))
- e idioma espa√±ol

## Summary

I have dockerized üê≥ most of my private projects for the ease of deployment and maintenance. Most of them are hosted on one DigitalOcean droplet, using a [docker based proxy](https://github.com/jkulak/docker-hub-proxy) to route the traffic.

I have set up monitoring for most of my private websites/services/experiments, using [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/): http://status.webascrazy.net/ and I strive for five 9's availability.

After looking at Rust, Erlang, Scala and Go, I have finally focused on Golang, and I will definitely continue in 2017. Some code is already out there on GitHub

* https://github.com/jkulak/gcompressor

After years of using git, I have decided to understand all (a lot) aspects of the tool. I have read many tutorials, most of the man pages, and watched hours of videos on YouTube. The result of that research is my git book/README.md file: https://github.com/jkulak/git-ninja that I plan to take further in 2017.

## Plans for 2017
- [ ] Become fluent in Golang (I want to be able to rate myself 4 out of 5 for Go knowledge)
- [ ] Contribute to Golang source code
- [ ] Make [Git ninja](https://github.com/jkulak/git-ninja) a solid resource for developers
- [ ] Publish at least 55 blog articles on webascrazy.net
