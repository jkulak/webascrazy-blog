I am listening to a lot of podcasts - usually while jogging, playing Playstation games, commuting, taking a longer walk. Couple of years ago I was able to listen to a podcast while programming - but now I find it difficult to focus on programming while still keeping track of what is going on in the podcast.

What I am looking for in the podcasts:

-   relaxed atmosphere with a large dose of wit
-   stick to the subject
-   great moderation (which makes a combination of both above possible)

Most of the podcasts that I am enjoying are about technology and science (economy, astronomy, and mixed).

I use "Overcast" application on my phone and <https://overcast.fm> website when listening on my laptop. After getting used to it first, now, I usually speed up the podcasts twice the speed to save some time, and to listen to more content within given time. It takes only a couple of days to get used to it - and it saves a lot of time. Overcast has the option to set the speed of playback.
